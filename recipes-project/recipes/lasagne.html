  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (3 ounce) package pancetta, minced</li>
    <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
    <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
    <li>½ cup diced yellow onion</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>7 ounces ground beef</li>
    <li>6 ounces ground pork</li>
    <li>½ cup dry red wine</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups plain tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 cups vegetable broth, or more as needed</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.</li>
    <li>Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. Continue simmering until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth only if absolutely necessary; ragu should drop, not run, off a spoon.</li>
    <li>Start preparing pasta after sauce has been cooking for 1 1/2 hours. Bring water and salt to a boil in a small saucepan. Add spinach and cover until it returns to a boil. Stir gently and cook until spinach is heated through. Remove from heat, leave covered, and let cool.</li>
    <li>Drain spinach in a mesh strainer set over a bowl, pressing it down with a fork to squeeze out as much water and possible; reserve the liquid. Puree spinach in a blender until smooth.</li>
  </ol>
